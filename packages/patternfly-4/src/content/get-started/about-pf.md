# About PatternFly 4
PatternFly is an open source design system that was created to enable consistency and usability across a wide range of applications and use cases. PatternFly provides clear standards, guidance, and tools to help designers and developers work together more efficiently to build better user experiences.

## Basic structure

### Components
Components, like buttons and alerts, can be assembled together to build applications.

### Layouts
Layouts are generic tools that allow you to structure and organize the content on your pages.

### Demos
Demos use components and layouts in combination to show you how to build more complex structures and application views.

## Style and design
### Styles
Styles like color, typography, and spacing define foundational elements of the design system.

### Design guidelines
Design guidelines communicate standards and best practices for common design patterns like navigation, dashboards, or forms.

## Additional tools
### Utilities
Utilities are a set of classes that enable you to customize and modify elements in your project without having to write any custom CSS.

For example, you might use a utility class to add additional spacing between elements, align content in a layout, or even add a box shadow to an element.

<!-- ### Variables
You can further customize PatternFly using the CSS variable system, which enables you to easily change things like color or shape without overwriting existing PatternFly styles. <Learn more about customizing with the variable system.>

Flexibility
PatternFly 4 was built to be flexible and is scoped to work in tandem with other design systems. This means you’re able to use PatternFly 4 components alongside components from systems like Bootstrap, Material.io, or older versions of PatternFly.

For example, our code is written like pf-c-alert
alert
